3 switches, A B C



turn switch A on and leave it on for a while, afterwards turn off switch A and turn on switch B

never turn on switch C



walking into the room I touch the bulbs



if one of the bulbs is lit, it is controlled by switch B

if one of the bulbs is off but its warm, it is controlled by switch A

if one of the bulbs is off and cold, it is controlled by switch C
