each person will be named after how long they take to cross the bridge:



my strategy is to pair the 2 slowest together

the fastest one returns with the torch



if I make the 2 slowest people cross together, the faster one isn't hindered

as much, ex- if I put 1 and 10 together, 1 is hindered a lot but not as much compared

to pairing 10 with 7, hence their time is not wasted as much and may be the

most optimal strategy(hopefully)



1 and 2 cross - takes 2 minutes

1 returns with the torch - 1 min



2+1=3



7 and 10 cross together - 10 mins



3+10=13



2 returns with the torch - 2 mins



13 + 2 = 15



1 and 2 cross again finally - 2 mins



15+2 = 17



TOTAL: 17 minutes
