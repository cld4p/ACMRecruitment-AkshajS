Initialization:

A=5

B=3

SUM=0



program then prints the initial values of a=5,b=3,sum=0



loop execution:

loop will run from i=1 upto b+1(4) but not including.

so the loop gives the values of i=1,i=2,i=3



iteration 1:

prints the current value of i, which is 1 using f string

print(f"\\nStep {i}:")

>>> Step 1:



prints the sum before the operation:

print("Before: SUM =", SUM)

>>> Before: SUM = 0



then add A to the sum

SUM = SUM + A



prints the sum after the operation:

print(f"Operation: SUM = SUM + A → {SUM}")

>>> Operation: SUM = SUM + A → 5



iteration 2:

prints the current value of i, which is 2 using f string

print(f"\\nStep {i}:")

>>> Step 2:



prints the sum before the operation:

print("Before: SUM =", SUM)

>>> Before: SUM = 5



then add A to the sum

SUM = SUM + A



prints the sum after the operation:

print(f"Operation: SUM = SUM + A → {SUM}")

>>> Operation: SUM = SUM + A → 10



iteration 3

prints the current value of i, which is 3 using f string

print(f"\\nStep {i}:")

>>> Step 3:



prints the sum before the operation:

print("Before: SUM =", SUM)

>>> Before: SUM = 10



then add A to the sum

SUM = SUM + A



prints the sum after the operation:

print(f"Operation: SUM = SUM + A → {SUM}")

>>> Operation: SUM = SUM + A → 15



Exit loop after the for loop values are exhausted

Go to the main code:

print("\\nFinal Output:", SUM)

prints the final value of SUM after the for loop execution which is 15

>>> Final Output: 15



Exit the code, TERMINATE PROGRAM
