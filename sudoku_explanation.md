row 4 must have remaining 3, columns 1 and 3 already have 3s, so the only spot is row 4



place the 1 in the top-left box

the top-left box 2x2 box needs a 1, row 2 already has a 1 so the box's 1 must be row 1, column 1 =1



the bottom right box needs a 1, column 4 already has a 1 so the box's 1 must be row 3, column 3=1



row 1 now has 1 and 4 and 3, so the remaining cell must be row1, column 4 =2



top right box currently has 3, 2, and 1 so the remaining cell is row 2, column 3 = 4



row 2 now has 3,4,1 so the only missing is 2



column 2 already has 4,3,1, so the remaining cell is row 3, column 2 =2 



row 3 has 3,2,1 so the last cell is row 3, column 4 =44



column 1 has 1,2,3 so row 4, column 1 = 4



column 3 has 3,4,1 so row 4, column 3 = 2
