The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa and among the 20 largest in the world. Located on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region near the Sudanese border, the dam is a gravity dam made of roller-compacted concrete. It is approximately 175 meters high and 1,780 meters long, with a reservoir surface area of about 1,875 square kilometers and a total volume of 74 billion cubic meters. The dam's primary purpose is electricity production to address Ethiopia's severe energy shortage and to enable electricity export to neighboring countries. It has an installed capacity of 5,150 megawatts, more than doubling Ethiopia's electricity production capacity. The first electricity generation began in 2022, and the dam officially inaugurated in September 2025. The dam is equipped with 13 Francis turbines, with an average annual production estimated at 15,700 gigawatt-hours. Besides power generation, the dam has a complex spillway system consisting of three spillways designed to handle severe flood events. The construction involved innovative engineering solutions, including advanced roller-compacted concrete mixtures to enhance durability and strength. An integrated monitoring system using sensors is installed for real-time structural performance analysis. The GERD has been a source of geopolitical tension, especially with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan, due to concerns over water flow and availability from the Nile River. Despite these concerns, Ethiopia views the dam as a crucial infrastructure for its economic growth and energy independence, aiming to electrify the region and reduce reliance on harmful fuels. This mega infrastructure project represents a landmark achievement for Ethiopia and Africa in hydropower development, with great significance for regional energy supply and economic development
